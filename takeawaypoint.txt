  /*  my profile controller
    send token from postman
    get token from postman
    verify token
        if not verify throw error
        else
           get id from token

  make varaible in postman => enviroment => global => usually for tokens and url  => is called inside {{variable}}

  send mail 
  nodemailer

  dotenv
      define variable in dot env
      get varaible of dot env(make a constant file and define all dotenv variavbles in there so we dont have to config in each file where we need dotenv variables)
      what type of variable are stored in dotenv
      make .env file outside src(in main directory)
      it uses  UPPERCASE_CASE_CONVENTION
      every data in dot env is considered as string so we dont need double quote.

      we can define variable in dotenv file but to use it we have import config and use config() function. now to  use we call as process.env.NAME where NAME  is a variable/
      EG: console.log(process.env.NAME)  // prabesh

      Things to declare in dotenv(can be changed/controlled by the owner ratherthan the developer)
      email
      password
      secretKey
      url
      DBURL(database url)

      if you make any changes in .env file, you need to restart the progress
